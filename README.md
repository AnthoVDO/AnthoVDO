### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my github page.  

I'm Anthony and I'm learning web developpement as a selftaught.

I'm using FreeCodeCamp as a path.

I already completed the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/anthovdo/responsive-web-design) and [Javascript Algorithm And Data Structure Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/anthovdo/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)

And now, I'm finishing the Front End Developpement Libraries Certification.

I already made some little project in HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, BootStrap and React.

I already learn a little about Node, Express and Puppeteer.

Have a nice code ðŸ˜„
